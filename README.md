# Control App Onboarding

Onboarding page for DYNAMO-Control-App, which is part of the DYNAMO project.

## Quick Start

For a quick start you can watch video tutorial: [![YouTube | Watch Tutorial](https://img.shields.io/badge/YouTube-Watch%20Tutorial-red?logo=youtube&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9R42T-7ykI)

But if you prefer text:

1. Fork this repository and clone it to your local machine
2. Run command `npm ci` to install all the dependencies (make sure that you have installed `pip` and `node` on your machine)
3. And now you're ready to run the app with `npm run dev` command
4. To run python bot put your tokens to `bot/.env` (use `bot/example.env` as an example). Then start the bot with `npm run bot` command

## Onboarding/Paywall configuration

The heart of this project lies in the configuration. By tweaking the configuration file, you can customize the onboarding experience according to your project's requirements. The configuration file can be found at [config.ts](./app/src/config.ts).

For detailed information on configuring the app, refer to the [Configuration Guide](./configuration-guide.md).

## Integrate onboarding into your bot
The perfect location for onboarding is right at the start of the bot. It will help you to brightly present your product to the user.

To integrate onboarding to your bot, you simply need to add a **button** with a link of your deployed onboarding web application. Telegram currently supports six different ways of [launching Mini Apps](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps#implementing-mini-apps). For onboadring launching we recommend using [MenuButton](https://core.telegram.org/api/bots/menu) or [KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/type/KeyboardButton).

### MenuButton
MenuButton is a special button which appears on the left side of the text input (see [@DurgerKingBot](https://t.me/DurgerKingBot)). This button can be configured without any server code in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather):

- Go to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) â†’ `/mybots` â†’ *Select yout bot* â†’ `Bot Settings` â†’ `Menu Button` â†’ *Send your onboarding URL* â†’ *Send button title (e.g. "Onboarding")*

Now Menu Button with onboarding will appear in your bot.

### KeyboardButton
Try KeyboardButton in action in our [Demo Bot](https://t.me/onboarding_kit_demo_bot). It utilizes Telegram's [KeyboardButton](https://core.telegram.org/type/KeyboardButton) with [Mini App URL](https://core.telegram.org/constructor/keyboardButtonSimpleWebView) inside.


Here's a snippet for `reply_markup` implemented with [python-telegram-bot](http://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/) library (see full implementation in [bot.py](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L81)):
```python
reply_markup = telegram.ReplyKeyboardMarkup.from_button(
   telegram.KeyboardButton(
      text="ðŸŒˆ Onboarding",
      web_app=telegram.WebAppInfo(url={ONBOARDING_URL})
   )
)
```

Note: KeyboardButton does't send any user data to Mini App (e.g. `language_code`). But you can send all the required data with HTTP GET parameters (see [this function](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L51) as reference).

### Adding payments
Good ending of onboarding is a **paywall**: User selects a product â†’ Chooses payment method â†’ Gets invoice in the chat. After the paywall the bot receives data about the selected product like:
```json
{
   "title": "Title",
   "description": "Description",
   "price": 5.99,
   "currency": "USD",
   "payment_method": "wallet_pay"
}
```
This data is used for ivoice generation. We implemented 2 different payment methods: native [Telegram Payments](https://core.telegram.org/bots/payments) and [ðŸ‘› Wallet Pay](https://pay.wallet.tg) (but generally any payment method can be integrated into such flow). You can find full code in [bot.py](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py):
- Telegram Payments: [[send invoice]](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L201) â€¢ [[check payment status]](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L235)
- ðŸ‘› Wallet Pay: [[send invoice]](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L245) â€¢ [[check payment status]](https://github.com/Easterok/telegram-onboarding-kit/blob/main/bot/bot.py#L326)
